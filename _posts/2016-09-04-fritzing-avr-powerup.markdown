I have been trying to get into PCB design lately. To design pcb or schematic,
  you need to know pcb design tools. There are few which can be used for this purpose.

  1. [kicad][kicad-link]
  2. [eagle cad][eaglecad-link]
  3. [Fritzing][fritz-link]

### Fritzing
I chose `Fritzing` since I am a beginner in pcb design. I think Fritzing is pretty easy to learn for a beginner. Learning `kicad` is in my todo though since its more powerful.

I made a very simple avr board schematic.
