In previous post [Creating Cheap PCBs In India for Makers: Designing and ordering, Part 1][prevpost-link], we have discussed about how to design PCB and finally 
how to order the pcbs from [LionCircuits][lioncircuits-link].
I have ordered my PCBs on `January 30 2017` and my PCBs were shipped on `Feb 7 2017` and it reached
to me on `Feb 10 2017`. So it took total `11 days` which is quite FAST if you compare it with other
PCBs manufacturers. Also it was a nice gesture from [LionsCircuit][lioncircuits-link] to give me 
`1000/- INR` bonus. :)

### soldering 
I don't have solder paste and hot air gun so I was totally relying on my solder iron and my skill to solder
this. Two boards turn out to be okay but I screwed one board while soldering because I put too much
force on pulling a stucked solder wire on solder pad. :/ Although a fine jumper wire could be used
to save this :). Probably I will do it later when I actually need to.
Also I need to order solder paste and good quality hot air gun now as I would be doing lot of `SMD` soldering
stuffs.

### Testing
The default setting in attiny13a is to use 9.6 MHz internal oscillator.

{% highlight C %}
ami@ami-desktop:~$ avrdude -c usbasp -p t13

avrdude: warning: cannot set sck period. please check for usbasp firmware update.
avrdude: AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructions

Reading | ################################################## | 100% 0.02s

avrdude: Device signature = 0x1e9007 (probably t13)

avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:FF, H:FF, L:7A)

avrdude done.  Thank you.

I did upload a blinking LED sketch which worked well. Check the video below.

### Reviews
Overall I am pretty happy with the quality of PCBs and the turn out time from ordering PCB to actually
get delivered to my door steps. I shall definetly order my PCBs from [LionCircuits][lioncircuits-link]
in future.
